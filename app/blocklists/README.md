EasyList adblock information
============================

These lists are provided by EasyList [here](https://easylist.to).
They can be used under the terms of the GNU GPL-3.0 and later versions.
For full license details see [this page](https://easylist.to/pages/licence.html).
All text files (filter lists) in this folder belong to "The EasyList authors (https://easylist.to/)".

Vieb uses these lists to block advertisements and trackers,
without connecting to external sites to update the lists.
If you always want to have the latest version of the easylists instead of these bundled ones,
change the adblocker setting from "static" to "update".
This will update the lists directly from the easylist website every time Vieb is started.
The bundled/static lists located here will be updated shortly before a new Vieb release.
