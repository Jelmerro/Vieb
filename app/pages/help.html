        <div>Welcome to Vieb</div>
    </div>
    <h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
    Welcome to Vieb's official, complete and offline documentation.
    You can ALWAYS come back to this page using <kbd>F1</kbd> from ANY mode.
    The documentation consists of a single page, separated into sections.
    These sections can be accessed using the table of contents,
    or by using the help command with the section as the first argument.
    Please make sure to read the first chapter called "Basics" to get started with Vieb,
    which will explain what commands are and why there is no mouse interaction.
    Use these steps to scroll the webpage:
    <ul>
        <li>Press <kbd>Escape</kbd> once to make sure you are in normal mode.</li>
        <li>Now scroll up and down with <kbd>k</kbd> and <kbd>j</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Vieb is short for "Vim Inspired Electron Browser" and can be found on
        <a href="https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb">github</a>.
    </p>
    <h1 id="contents">Contents</h1>
    <div class="toc">
    </div>
    <h1 id="basics">Basics</h1>
    Interaction with Vieb is heavily focused on the keyboard,
    and is mostly inspired by the popular text editor Vim.
    If you think a key is mapped to a weird keyboard combination,
    it's probably because it's also weird in Vim.
    Clicking links, scrolling, navigating,
    and most other tasks have dedicated keyboard shortcuts.
    The most important ones will be explained in this chapter.
    Single key actions will be listed like this <kbd>f</kbd>,
    modifiers such as shift will be displayed as: <kbd>Shift with f</kbd>.
    <h2 id="basics-modes">modes</h2>
    Vieb uses different modes to separate functionality.
    By default, you should be in normal mode,
    but you can go back to normal mode at any time by pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd>.
    The mode is always prominently displayed in the navbar,
    between the Vieb logo and the url input.
    Modes can be switched to by pressing a certain key from normal mode.
    Aside from normal mode, the following modes are available:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="nav">Nav</span>
            - Upon pressing <kbd>e</kbd> you can enter a url to navigate to,
            and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to navigate or as always <kbd>Escape</kbd> to cancel.
            The navigation bar will change color when text is entered.
            An orange border indicates the user input will be used to search with the search engine.
            A yellow border is shown for local files or directories.
            A cyan border indicates that the entered text is detected as a website,
            which will result in a direct navigation.
            Suggestions from your browsing history will appear when typing.
            Webpages you visit often or those that match more closely with your search will appear at the top of the list.
            A green border is shown when a suggestion is selected, which also results in direct navigation.
            You can switch between the suggestions with <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with Tab</kbd>,
            after which you can select a suggestion by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="insert">Insert</span>
            - This mode is used to interact with the website normally.
            It brings back mouse interaction and passes all keyboard inputs to the website.
            If the cursor is pointing at a url, the url will be shown at the bottom of the screen.
            However, insert mode should not be overused in Vieb,
            because a lot of the advantages Vieb has to offer are unavailable in this mode.
            If you really need or want to enter insert mode, press <kbd>i</kbd>.
            The follow(ing) mode describes a much faster way to follow links or buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="follow">Follow</span>
            - Upon pressing <kbd>f</kbd> all links and buttons on the page will be assigned a key.
            When pressing the key next to a link, Vieb will click on the link.
            If there are a lot of links on the page, sometimes two keys are needed.
            You don't need to press these together, but simply after each other.
            To open links in a new tab, use <kbd>Shift with f</kbd> instead of <kbd>f</kbd>.
            Some buttons and other type of links can't be opened in a new tab.
            The different colors indicate the different type of links:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#follow">Regular link to the follow mode chapter</a>
                    will be outlined in blue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Checkboxes and buttons
                    <input type="checkbox">
                    <button onclick="changeColor(this)">
                        Button
                    </button>
                    will be outlined in red.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <input type="text">
                    Text input fields will enter insert mode and will be outlined in green.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span onclick="changeColor(this)">
                        Elements with JavaScript event handlers
                    </span>
                    will be outlined in orange.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Press <kbd>f</kbd> to see the difference for the examples above.
            Remember that you can always go back to normal mode with <kbd>Escape</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="command">Command</span>
            - Some functionality is accessed by executing commands.
            These can be entered after pressing <kbd>Shift with ;</kbd> (also known as <kbd>:</kbd>).
            A very important command is the quit command,
            as it's the only way to properly quit Vieb.
            For more detailed instructions on how to use this command,
            please refer to the dedicated paragraph <a href="#commands-quit">here</a>.
            You can switch between the suggestions with <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with Tab</kbd>,
            after which you can select a suggestion by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
            You can also access previously executed commands with <kbd>Ctrl with n</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with p</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="search">Search</span>
            - This mode can be entered with <kbd>/</kbd>.
            After entering a string, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to search for it.
            You can now press <kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with n</kbd> to find next or previous matches.
            Searching is by default case-sensitive.
            When focussed on an element after searching, you can press <kbd>Enter</kbd> again to click on it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="cursor">Cursor</span>
            - In this mode a blinking cursor will appear which can be moved around using Vim keybindings.
            If can also be used to hover over links or to scroll inside smaller scrollboxes.
            It's also possible to save images or preview url locations from this mode.
            It can be entered by pressing <kbd>c</kbd>.
            The complete list of movement options can be found <a href="#cursor">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="visual">Visual</span>
            - This mode can only be entered from cursor mode using the <kbd>v</kbd> key.
            It can be used to select and copy text using the keyboard.
            When switching from cursor mode to visual mode,
            the existing location will be saved as the starting point for the selection.
            The cursor can then be moved freely similar to cursor mode,
            with text being selected between the two locations.
            Similar to all other modes, you can exit this mode using <kbd>Escape</kbd>,
            or by pressing <kbd>y</kbd> to copy the selected text.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Now that all the different modes have been explained,
    a separate paragraph will explain how to use the basics of normal mode.
    <h2 id="basics-normal">normal mode</h2>
    Most functionality is accessed from normal mode using the keyboard.
    It offers a large list of shortcuts to interact with the website.
    Aside from the keys to switch modes mentioned in the previous paragraph,
    these are the most important when in normal mode:
    <ul>
        <li>Moving around with a single press of <kbd>h j k l</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Zoom in and out using <kbd>Ctrl with +</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl with -</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Reset to the normal zoom level by pressing <kbd>Ctrl with 0</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Go back and forward in history using <kbd>Shift with h</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with l</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Open a new tab with <kbd>t</kbd>.</li>
        <li>
            Switch between tabs with <kbd>w</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd>
            or using <kbd>Shift with j</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with k</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>Reload the page with <kbd>r</kbd> and without cache using <kbd>Shift with r</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Close a tab with the <kbd>d</kbd> key.</li>
        <li>Reopen a previously closed tab with <kbd>u</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    When you are done mastering these, please take a look at the
    <a href="#normal">complete list of them here</a>.
    <h2 id="basics-summary">summary</h2>
    This concludes the basic usage of Vieb.
    If anything is still unclear after reading this chapter,
    just try it out or read the dedicated chapter for it.
    If it's too much to remember at once, start with these:
    <ul>
        <li>This help page can ALWAYS be found by pressing <kbd>F1</kbd>.</li>
        <li>You can ALWAYS go back to normal mode with <kbd>Escape</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="settings">Settings</h1>
    Vieb has a lot of settings, including custom keybindings.
    There are two ways to change the settings:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the defaults using a viebrc.json file.</li>
        <li>Change a setting for just the current session, with :set.</li>
    </ul>
    The settings file is loaded on startup,
    and can be reloaded at anytime with the `:r` or `:reload` command.
    All settings in this file are optional and will override the default setting.
    Alternatively, settings can be changed for the current session with the `:set` command.
    For example, to use system notifications for as long as Vieb is running,
    open command mode with `:` and enter this command:
    <pre class="command-block">set notification.system=true</pre>
    Vieb's set command syntax is very similar to regular Vim.
    You can read settings using "set setting?" or toggle booleans with "set setting!", for example:
    <pre class="command-block">set notification.system! notification?</pre>
    The settings file is case sensitive, just like the set command arguments.
    Some settings can only be changed on startup or using the viebrc config,
    you will get a notification for these settings with instructions.
    Running the `:reload` command will reset any prior `:set` commands,
    because all settings will be reset and reapplied from the settings file.
    <h2 id="settings-viebrc">viebrc</h2>
    In this file you can change settings and the keybindings of Vieb.
    By default, this file does not exist and the original value for all settings will be used.
    You can generate a viebrc.json with the current settings using <a href="#commands-mkviebrc">mkviebrc</a>.
    Depending on your operating system, the location of this file will be different:
    <ul>
        <li>Windows - <kbd>%APPDATA%\Vieb\viebrc.json</kbd>
        <li>Mac - <kbd>~/Library/Application Support/Vieb/viebrc.json</kbd>
        <li>Linux - <kbd>~/.config/Vieb/viebrc.json</kbd>
    </ul>
    The same folder is used for all other information that Vieb stores,
    which means there should be Electron/Chromium related files there.
    The settings previewed below will update when executing :set and :reload commands.
    You can create a viebrc file with all your current settings using ":mkviebrc".
    To also store the defaults using this command, execute it like so: ":mkviebrc full".
    Once you're done with your changes, you can always generate a config with only the changed values,
    by running the "mkviebrc" command again without the "full" argument.
    Finally, there are also example configs to replicate Firefox or Chromium on
    <a href="https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb">github</a>.
    They are stored in the examples folder and improvements are always welcome.
    Below is a valid viebrc.json file containing of all your current settings including defaults.
    <pre class="current-settings wrap"></pre>
    Please note that the download, tab and browsing history are separately configured.
    Therefor it's possible to keep and restore the open tabs without keeping the other browsing history.
    More information about the history settings can be found in <a href="#history">the history chapter</a>.
    To find the right setting for you, the set command can be used at runtime to test a specific setting.
    <h2 id="settings-vimmode">vim mode</h2>
    Vieb has an option to edit form fields using Vim.
    By default you can open Vim from insert mode using <kbd>Ctrl with i</kbd>.
    When no input field is focussed, the shortcut will not open Vim.
    The setting "vimcommand" is used to execute Vim on your system.
    This setting is set to "gvim" by default for cross-system compatibility,
    but it can be changed to any command you want.
    On systems with gnome-terminal installed you could set it to:
    <pre class="command-block">gnome-terminal -- vim</pre>
    This will open a new gnome-terminal with Vim.
    The form edit mode watches the file for changes, and inserts text based on that.
    The recommended way to quit Vim when combined with the form input edit mode is ":x".
    It's also entirely possible to use any other editor here,
    as long as it takes the filename as an argument.
    <h2 id="settings-keybindings">keybindings</h2>
    The viebrc is the only place to change the keybindings.
    Changing them can be done by overwriting existing ones,
    or by adding completely new bindings.
    To remap a certain action, simply overwrite the old one with ""
    and create a new one with the same functionality.
    The identifiers for the keys are Vieb specific,
    and are a combination of the active modifiers and the JavaScript key.code.
    There is a third-party website where you can check the code for the key being pressed,
    which can be found <a href="https://keycode.info">here</a>.
    Make sure to enter insert mode and look at the "event.code" field.
    Once you know the keycode, you can combine it with the modifiers like so:
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>C-KeyQ</kbd> means to press Ctrl with q.</li>
        <li><kbd>CS-KeyT</kbd> means to press Ctrl and Shift with t.</li>
        <li><kbd>F1</kbd> means to only press F1 without any other key.</li>
        <li>
            <kbd>CSMA-F2</kbd>
            means to hold Ctrl, Shift, Meta and Alt while pressing F2.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Please note that the order of the modifiers is important,
    and that they are always in uppercase.
    This means that <kbd>sc-KeyT</kbd> and <kbd>SC-KeyT</kbd> won't work,
    but <kbd>CS-KeyT</kbd> will.
    Below is a list of all the possible actions you can choose:
    <pre class="supported-actions wrap"></pre>
    You can also bind keys to commands, this example toggles container tabs using F9:
    <pre>"F9": ":set newtab.container!"</pre>
    For a list of all the available commands, please check the <a href="#commands">commands chapter</a>.
    In the next paragraph, the set command will be explained.
    <h2 id="settings-set">set command</h2>
    The set command can be used to change the settings after startup.
    When starting Vieb, the settings file is loaded and merged with the defaults.
    After that, most settings can be changed using the set command.
    For example, to use system notifications instead of Vieb's own notification system,
    go to command mode using <kbd>Shift with ;</kbd> (or <kbd>:</kbd>) and enter this command:
    <pre class="command-block">set notification.system=true</pre>
    The set command along with other commands has autocompletion by default,
    which helps with finding the right setting name.
    Settings can be changed as many times as you like,
    and can be reset and reloaded from the settings file with:
    <pre class="command-block">reload</pre> or just "r" for short.
    If the settings file was not changed after startup,
    running this command will results in the settings being reset to startup configuration.
    This means that it's a fast way to undo any set commands,
    but it can also be used to change the keybindings at runtime.
    To achieve this, simple edit the viebrc.json after Vieb was started,
    and use the reload command to apply all changes.
    Vieb only reads the settings file on startup and with the reload command,
    and only writes to the file when explicitly asked to do so with the <a href="#commands-mkviebrc">mkviebrc</a> command.
    This means it's always safe to edit the viebrc file.
    <h3 id="settings-set-reading">reading</h3>
    It's also possible to find the current setting value.
    To find out if system notifications are in use,
    execute the following command:
    <pre class="command-block">set notification.system?</pre>
    You can also read an entire collection of settings at once,
    the next command will list all the permission settings:
    <pre class="command-block">set permissions?</pre>
    The question mark can also be left out, if that's preferred.
    <h3 id="settings-set-validation">validation</h3>
    The set command can be a useful tool to help with finding the right settings.
    On startup, Vieb informs the user of any mistakes made,
    and the set command will show the same warnings.
    For example, to disable the case sensitive search,
    the correct command would be:
    <pre class="command-block">set ignorecase=true</pre>
    If we would try to set the value to anything other than true or false,
    a warning would be displayed that a boolean is expected.
    Boolean values can also be toggled with:
    <pre class="command-block">set newtab.nextToCurrentOne!</pre>
    All arguments are case sensitive, similar to the settings file.
    If a command does not show a notification,
    it means that the setting was successfully executed and applied.
    Similar to Vim, it's also possible to input multiple arguments to set, for example:
    <pre class="command-block">set notification.system! notification</pre>
    This will toggle the use of system notification and show the current notification settings.
    <h1 id="startup">Startup</h1>
    By default, all the tabs from the previous session will be opened (tabs.restore),
    along with the configured startup tabs (tabs.startup).
    This behaviour can be changed in settings as listed between the brackets.
    Your tabs will also be stored when closed (tabs.keepRecentlyClosed),
    so you can reopen them with <kbd>u</kbd>.
    When "tabs.restore" is disabled, but "tabs.keepRecentlyClosed" is enabled,
    all your open tabs will be moved to the recently closed tab list when quitting Vieb.
    When both settings are set to false, no tab history is preserved,
    and no closed tabs can be reopened as a result.
    These settings do not influence the other history settings,
    just like the history settings don't change the tab and startup behaviour.
    You can learn more about the history settings in <a href="#history">the history chapter</a>.
    <h2 id="startup-arguments">arguments</h2>
    Vieb can be started without any command-line arguments,
    but there are some available to use.
    First there is "--help" to display information about all the startup arguments.
    There is also a "--version" argument, to display the version and exit.
    Use "--portable" to store all Vieb data in a relative folder named "ViebData".
    Lastly, you can provide "--debug" or "--console" to open the Vieb with debug tools or the console,
    which is the internal console of Vieb and not the one used to inspect websites.
    The "--debug" argument implies "--console", but with additional changes,
    such as the presence of the Electron menu bar.
    For the website console, see the <a href="#commands-devtools">devtools command</a>.
    Arguments not starting with "-" will be parsed and opened as a url.
    These urls can take any form if you include the protocol/schema,
    or will automatically be prefixed with "https://".
    You can provide as many urls as you want,
    as each of them will be opened in a separate tab, similar to the tabs.startup setting.
    <h2 id="startup-examples">examples</h2>
    To get a better understanding of these arguments,
    there are a couple of examples shown in this paragraph.
    To add arguments to a regular Vieb executable,
    simply add them like so:
    <pre class="command-block">vieb --help</pre>
    Where "vieb" should be the name of the executable,
    such as "Vieb.exe" on Windows.
    To open two websites on startup with Vieb's internal console open,
    you can start vieb with the following arguments:
    <pre class="command-block">
        vieb --console "http://example.com" "github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb"
    </pre>
    Note that the github url will be prefixed with "https://",
    because we omitted the schema/protocol from the url.
    If you want always want to open these pages on startup,
    add them to the list of startup tabs (tabs.startup) in your viebrc.json config.
    If you start Vieb with with npm,
    make sure you have already done "npm install" and run the following:
    <pre class="command-block">npm start -- --help</pre>
    This will passs the "--help" argument to Vieb,
    which should now display all the available startup arguments.
    Note that with npm it's required to separate the npm arguments from the Vieb arguments,
    by adding the extra "--" between them.
    <h1 id="normal">Normal mode</h1>
    In the basics chapter the most useful keyboard shortcuts are mentioned,
    but this chapter lists all of the default normal mode actions available:
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>F1</kbd> Opens this help page, similar to the help command.</li>
        <li><kbd>b</kbd> and <kbd>w</kbd> to switch to the previous and next tab.</li>

        <li>
            Open a new tab with <kbd>t</kbd>.
            By default this binding will open a new tab next to the current one.
            The position of the new tab can be configured with the setting "newtab.nextToCurrentOne".
            You can also disable the top visited site suggestions with "newtab.showTopSites".
            Finally, you can also automatically switch to nav mode when opening a new tab, by setting "newtab.enterNavMode" to true.
        </li>
        <li>
            <kbd>Ctrl with t</kbd> can be used to open the tabs at the alternative position without changing the setting each time.
            By default this will open the new tab at the end of all the open tabs.
            If the alternative position (at the end instead of next to the current one) is preferred,
            you can change it by setting "newtab.nextToCurrentOne" to false.
        </li>
        <li>Open a new tab with the current website location pre-filled in nav mode using <kbd>Shift with t</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Close the current tab with <kbd>d</kbd>.</li>
        <li>
            Reopen previously closed tabs with <kbd>u</kbd>.
            The position of the restored tab can be configured with the setting "newtab.nextToCurrentOne".
        </li>
        <li>Switch to search mode with <kbd>/</kbd>.</li>
        <li>
            Find the next or previous match when searching using
            <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with n</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>When a search match is selected, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to click on the selected search.</li>
        <li>
            Go forward or backwards in the tab browsing history using
            <kbd>Shift with l</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with h</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Alternatively, you can use
            <kbd>Ctrl with i</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with o</kbd> to navigate the history.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use <kbd>Ctrl with x</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with a</kbd> to decrease or increment the page number.
            For example, urls with "page=5" can be incremented to "page=6".
            If no supported attributes are found, the first number in the url is incremented or decreased.
        </li>
        <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl with c</kbd> to stop loading the current page.</li>
        <li>
            Scroll half a page up or down using
            <kbd>Ctrl with u</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl with d</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>Or an entire page by pressing <kbd>Ctrl with b</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with f</kbd>.</li>
        <li>To scroll an entire page horizontally, use <kbd>^</kbd> and <kbd>$</kbd> (shift 4 and 6).</li>
        <li>Go to command mode using <kbd>Shift with ;</kbd> (also known as <kbd>:</kbd>).</li>
        <li>Zoom in or out by pressing <kbd>Ctrl with +</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with -</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Reset the zoom to 100% again using <kbd>Ctrl with 0</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Enter <a href="#cursor">cursor mode</a> using <kbd>c</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd>v</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    Aside from these, any number of digits can be entered before executing an action,
    which will result in the action being executed for the number of times entered.
    For example, pressing <kbd>2</kbd> and then <kbd>j</kbd> will result in scrolling down twice.
    This can be disabled by overwriting the action for any of the digits.
    To disable the repeat action behaviour entirely, set "digitsRepeatActions" to false in the settings.
    This repeat action behaviour is also present in <a href="#cursor">cursor</a> and <a href="#visual">visual</a> mode.
    <h1 id="follow">Follow mode</h1>
    This mode is a very important mode of Vieb,
    as it allows you to click on links or other elements using the keyboard.
    There are three versions of follow mode, each with a different use case.
    All variations will automatically update the follow links when the page is updated.
    <h2 id="follow-click">follow by click</h2>
    After pressing <kbd>f</kbd> from normal mode,
    all clickable elements should be assigned a key next to them.
    After choosing the key, Vieb will emulate a click on the chosen element.
    For the regular follow mode, these come in four flavours:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Regular anchor tags (a) outlined in blue -
            These will be clickable in regardless of the href attribute's value,
            even for href values such as "#".
            The result will be no different from clicking a link using a regular browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clickable input elements (checkboxes, radio and other buttons) outlined in red -
            These will be clicked on with no real differences compared to a regular browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            Input fields (textarea and inputs) outlined in green -
            These will be focused by clicking on them.
            Unlike other follow mode types,
            Vieb will not go back to normal mode but enter Insert mode directly.
            This allows you to start typing in the input field after choosing it with follow mode.
            When in normal mode, you can also jump to the first text input using <kbd>g i</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Onclick handlers outlined in orange -
            Elements with JavaScript event handlers will be made clickable.
            Both the onclick attribute and elements with event listeners are supported.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Clicking links with the mouse when using insert mode will mostly do the same thing.
    <h2 id="follow-newtab">follow in new tab</h2>
    The <kbd>Shift with f</kbd> key allows you to open links in a new tab.
    Unlike the regular follow mode, only direct links will be available to click on.
    These links will not be opened by emulating a mouse click,
    but by opening a new tab with the href attribute as the url.
    Therefor only anchor tags with valid urls will be made clickable.
    To open pages in a new tab without switching to them,
    enter the keys while holding Shift.
    This can be used to open multiple links on the page before switching,
    because follow mode will stay active when opening links with Shift down.
    <h2 id="follow-cursor">follow mode to move the cursor</h2>
    Finally you can use follow mode to move the cursor when in cursor or visual mode.
    Just like in normal mode, you need to press <kbd>f</kbd> to start follow mode.
    Instead of clicking on the element you select, the cursor will move to the selected element.
    The link will not be clicked or opened immediately, but the cursor will hover over it.
    After choosing a link, you will return to the mode you were originally in.
    An example of how to use this follow mode to move the cursor:
    <ul>
        <li>You want to select and copy text between element A and element B.</li>
        <li>From normal mode, we press <kbd>c</kbd> to enter cursor mode.</li>
        <li>Now press <kbd>f</kbd> to select an element on the page to move to.</li>
        <li>Select element A by pressing the keys next to element A.</li>
        <li>Vieb will return to cursor mode and move the cursor to element A.</li>
        <li>Element A will now be hovered by the cursor, but has not been clicked.</li>
        <li>Now go to visual mode using <kbd>v</kbd> to start selecting text.</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>f</kbd> again to activate follow mode, this time from visual mode.</li>
        <li>Select element B by pressing the keys next to element B.</li>
        <li>Vieb will now go back to visual mode.</li>
        <li>The text between element A and element B is now selected, you can copy it using <kbd>y</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="cursor">Cursor mode</h1>
    Cursor mode can be used to move "cursor" using the keyboard.
    It is required to enter cursor mode before going to visual mode.
    To enter cursor mode, press <kbd>c</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd>v</kbd> when in normal mode.
    When in cursor mode, hover events will be triggered when moving the cursor.
    If the cursor is pointing at a url, the url will be shown at the bottom of the screen.
    Aside from that, images can be downloaded and urls can be copied.
    Lastly, cursor mode can be used to scroll inside scrollable elements smaller than the main window.
    The following actions are available by default in cursor mode:
    <ul>
        <li>Use <kbd>h j k l</kbd> to move the cursor around.</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>f</kbd> to move the cursor to the location of an element on the page, see <a href="#follow-cursor">follow cursor</a> for details.</li>
        <li>You can download the image or svg at the current position using <kbd>d</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>y</kbd> to copy the current url under the cursor to the clipboard.</li>
        <li>Execute a regular mouse click by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Start inspecting at the current cursor location with <kbd>e</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Click and enter insert mode at the cursor location using <kbd>i</kbd>.</li>
        <li>For a right mouse click use <kbd>r</kbd>.</li>
        <li>To jump a larger distance horizontally, use <kbd>w</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>g g</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with g</kbd> to scroll to the top or bottom of the page.</li>
        <li>Entering <kbd>Shift with h</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with l</kbd> will move the cursor to the top or bottom of the view.</li>
        <li>To execute a vertical scrolling action at the current position, use <kbd>Shift with j</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with k</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, you can also use the <kbd>BracketLeft</kbd> and <kbd>BracketRight</kbd> keys to scroll vertically.</li>
        <li>For horizontal scrolling use <kbd>Shift with Comma</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with Dot</kbd> (the horizontal carets on your keyboard).</li>
        <li>The keys <kbd>^</kbd> and <kbd>$</kbd> will move the cursor to the end or the beginning of the view.</li>
        <li>Combining <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>h j k l</kbd> will move the cursor by one pixel in each direction.</li>
        <li>To move fast up and down, use <kbd>Ctrl with u</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with d</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Finally, pressing <kbd>v</kbd> when in cursor mode, will enter visual mode.</li>
    </ul>
    Some movement actions will also scroll the window when reaching the bottom or top of the current view.
    <h2 id="cursor-scrolling">scrolling</h2>
    When scrolling in cursor mode, the page will scroll by executing mouse scroll events at the cursor location.
    Unlike the regular scrolling in normal mode, this results in smooth scrolling.
    Another difference, is that the scroll event will target the current element instead of the window.
    This means that you can scroll inside any scrollable element with cursor mode.
    It's also an option to execute the cursor scroll from other modes,
    by changing the keybindings to "CURSOR.-something-" (see <a href="#settings-keybindings">keybindings</a> for a list).
    Keep in mind that the smooth scroll of cursor mode will always be executed at the cursor location,
    even when the cursor isn't shown in the current mode (for example normal mode).
    <h1 id="visual">Visual mode</h1>
    This is the only mode than can not be directly entered from normal mode,
    but is instead entered after pressing <kbd>v</kbd> from cursor mode.
    The main purpose of this mode is to select and copy text.
    The full list of options looks like this:
    <ul>
        <li>Use <kbd>h j k l</kbd> to move the cursor around.</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>f</kbd> to move the cursor to the location of an element on the page, see <a href="#follow-cursor">follow cursor</a> for details.</li>
        <li>To jump a larger distance horizontally, use <kbd>w</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>g g</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with g</kbd> to scroll to the top or bottom of the page.</li>
        <li>Entering <kbd>Shift with h</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with l</kbd> will move the cursor to the top or bottom of the view.</li>
        <li>To execute a vertical scrolling action at the current position, use <kbd>Shift with j</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with k</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, you can also use the <kbd>BracketLeft</kbd> and <kbd>BracketRight</kbd> keys to scroll vertically.</li>
        <li>For horizontal scrolling use <kbd>Shift with Comma</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with Dot</kbd> (the horizontal carets on your keyboard).</li>
        <li>The keys <kbd>^</kbd> and <kbd>$</kbd> will move the cursor to the end or the beginning of the view.</li>
        <li>Combining <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>h j k l</kbd> will move the cursor by one pixel in each direction.</li>
        <li>To move fast up and down, use <kbd>Ctrl with u</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with d</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Finally, pressing <kbd>y</kbd> or <kbd>c</kbd> will copy the selection to the system clipboard.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="commands">Commands</h1>
    In this chapter all the available commands will be listed and explained.
    By default, all supported commands will be autocompleted using a suggestions dropdown menu,
    similar to the nav mode suggestions.
    These suggestions can be disabled for commands by setting "suggestCommands" to false.
    You can switch between suggestions using <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with Tab</kbd>,
    after which you can execute the command using <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
    Previously executed commands are stored during the current session,
    and can be accessed using <kbd>Ctrl with n</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with p</kbd>.
    It's also possible to type only the first part of a command name,
    if that's the only one starting with the entered text (for example, ":dev" will execute devtools).
    The full list of commands is as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>help (or h)</li>
        <li>version (or v)</li>
        <li>downloads (or d)</li>
        <li>history</li>
        <li>devtools</li>
        <li>set (or s)</li>
        <li>reload</li>
        <li>mkviebrc (or mkv)</li>
        <li>hardcopy (or print)</li>
        <li>buffer (or b)</li>
        <li>cookies</li>
        <li>write (or w)</li>
        <li>quit (or q)</li>
    </ul>
    Each paragraph in this chapter will explain a single command from the list above.
    <h2 id="commands-help">help</h2>
    The help command can be used as an alternative for the <kbd>F1</kbd> key.
    Optionally, the help command takes a single argument,
    which can be used to refer to a section of this help page.
    For example, to navigate to the basics chapter:
    <pre class="command-block">help basics</pre>
    This command can also be used when this help page is already open,
    as it will simply move the page to the right section.
    The help command can be shortened by only using "h".
    All paragraphs are prefixed with the chapter they are in,
    and as a result the current paragraph can be opened directly with:
    <pre class="command-block">h commands-help</pre>
    <h2 id="commands-version">version</h2>
    The version command takes no arguments.
    It is used to display version information about Vieb.
    There are versions listed for Vieb and Chromium,
    and you can also navigate to the github repository from the version page.
    The version command is also available as "v".
    <h2 id="commands-downloads">downloads</h2>
    The downloads command takes no arguments.
    The short version of this command is "d".
    This page can be used to view all the downloaded files.
    To learn more about the download page and other special pages,
    check out the <a href="#special">Special pages</a>.
    <h2 id="commands-history">history</h2>
    The history command takes no arguments.
    This command will open a list of all the website visited.
    To learn more about Vieb's history settings and configurations,
    see <a href="#special-history">history page info</a> or <a href="#history">the history chapter</a>.
    <h2 id="commands-devtools">devtools</h2>
    The devtools command takes no arguments.
    This command can be used to open to open the developer tools for the current website.
    The short version of this command is "dev".
    To open the Vieb developer/debug console, see the <a href="#startup">startup options</a>.
    <h2 id="commands-set">set</h2>
    This command has already been mostly explained in <a href="#settings-set">this paragraph</a>.
    To summarize, this command can be used to set any setting during runtime,
    without saving it to the viebrc.json settings/config file.
    Writing a new setting with the set command works like this:
    <pre class="command-block">set downloads.path=~/Documents</pre>
    Boolean values can also be toggled like this:
    <pre class="command-block">set history.storeNewVisits!</pre>
    For example, to increase the notification duration for the current session,
    use the following command (from 6 seconds to 10 seconds):
    <pre class="command-block">set notification.duration=10000</pre>
    If no notification is shown, the setting was successfully applied.
    Note that the duration and position of the notifications can only be changed
    if the Vieb notifications are used instead of system notifications.
    Vieb will automatically block websites with an invalid or missing certificate,
    and display an error page when this happens, similar to unreachable pages.
    If you prefer to be redirected automatically, set "redirectToHttp" to true.
    The set command can also be used to read the current value of a setting:
    <pre class="command-block">set redirectToHttp?</pre>
    The question mark at the end is optional, similar to Vim.
    <h2 id="commands-reload">reload</h2>
    The reload command can be used to reload the settings from the settings file.
    It takes no arguments, required or optional.
    All previous "set" command changes are reset by using reload,
    so it can be used to undo any unwanted changes made using the set command.
    It can also be used to change the <a href="#settings-viebrc-keybindings">keybindings</a> at runtime.
    A short version of the reload command is just using "r".
    <h2 id="commands-mkviebrc">mkviebrc</h2>
    This command can be used to write all the current settings to the viebrc file.
    When this commands is run without any arguments,
    it only includes the settings that have been changed compared to their default setting.
    The short version of the command is "mkv".
    <pre class="command-block">mkv</pre>
    It can be used to write the changes made by the set command back to the config.
    Mkviebrc has a single optional argument that must be set to "full" if provided.
    The difference is that all settings will be written to the viebrc,
    including those with the default value.
    <pre class="command-block">mkviebrc full</pre>
    This can be used in case you never want the current defaults to change,
    or because you want to get more familiar with all the different settings.
    It's always possible to run the command again without the "full" argument,
    to remove the settings with defaults from the config again.
    <h2 id="commands-hardcopy">hardcopy</h2>
    The hardcopy command can be used to print the current page.
    There are no arguments for this command.
    The alternative name for this command is print.
    <h2 id="commands-buffer">buffer</h2>
    The buffer command is used to quickly switch between tabs by name.
    The short version of this command is "b".
    For example, to quickly switch to an open tab of the vieb github page,
    the following command could be used:
    <pre class="command-block">b github vieb</pre>
    You don't have type this out completely, the first match will be selected.
    Depending on the tabs you have open, only typing "b gi" could be enough.
    If your preferred tab is not the first suggestion, you can tab between suggestions.
    Each tab is numbered, and the number can also be used to switch to a certain tab.
    For example, the following command switches to the 1st tab (index starts at 0):
    <pre class="command-block">b 0</pre>
    Using this command, you can also map keyboard shortcuts to switch to specific tabs.
    The search is based on the page title, url and the tab index.
    If the search string only includes numbers, you will switch to the tab by index,
    regardless of the order in which the suggestions are shown.
    <h2 id="commands-cookies">cookies</h2>
    The cookies command is used to open the special page named cookies.
    It can also be accessed at "vieb://cookies".
    Only the cookies of the main session will be listed.
    See the <a href="#special-cookies">cookies page info</a> for more details.
    <h2 id="commands-write">write</h2>
    This command can be used to write the HTML of the current page to a file.
    The short version of this command is "w".
    It has an optional argument to set the write location of the page.
    If not set, the downloads folder and current page title are combined to form the name.
    Relative paths will be prefixed with the downloads folder, so only the name will be changed.
    If the location is set to a folder instead of a file,
    the page title will still be used as the save location in the specified folder.
    Finally, it's also possible to provide and absolute path to a file,
    in which case the exact path entered will be used to save the page to.
    The basic usage without any arguments (w is short for write):
    <pre class="command-block">w</pre>
    Download the page to the Documents folder with the page title as the filename:
    <pre class="command-block">w ~/Documents</pre>
    Note that if there is no folder named Documents inside the home folder,
    the save location will be the home directory with Documents as the file name.
    <h2 id="commands-quit">quit</h2>
    Last but not least is the quit command.
    This simple command takes no arguments,
    and is the proper way to quit Vieb.
    These are the steps to quit Vieb regardless of mode:
    <ul>
        <li>Press <kbd>Escape</kbd> to go back to normal mode (Escape does nothing when already in normal mode).</li>
        <li>Use <kbd>Shift with ;</kbd> or <kbd>:</kbd> to enter command mode.</li>
        <li>Type "quit" into the navbar and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    The short version of the quit command is "q".
    <h1 id="history">History</h1>
    Your browsing, download, favicon and tab history are automatically stored when using Vieb with the default settings.
    Each of these parts have separate settings to configure how and if they should store your history.
    <h2 id="history-browsing">browsing history</h2>
    All websites you visit are stored in a "hist" file inside Vieb's config folder.
    Every time a page is loaded, the hist file is appended with a single line.
    By default, suggestions will be displayed when in nav mode.
    These suggestions are entirely based on websites you have previously visited.
    The navigation bar will turn green when a suggestion is selected,
    cyan for direct navigations, yellow for local files and orange for search requests.
    Webpages you visit often or those that match more closely with your search will appear at the top of the list.
    These suggestions can be disabled by setting "history.suggest" to false.
    To change or disable the browsing history, there are two other settings:
    <ul>
        <li>
            history.clearOnQuit - when this setting is set to true,
            the browsing history is cleared when quitting Vieb.
            This will not clear the currently opened tabs or the download history,
            but only influences if the browsing history should be cleared on exit.
        </li>
        <li>
            history.storeNewVisits - when this setting is true,
            your browsing history is extended for every page you visit.
            This means that once a page is loaded, the url, the title and the date of the visit will be stored.
            When this setting is set to false, no new entries will be added for new site visits.
            This setting does not influence the previously stored history,
            or the download and tab history.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="history-favicons">favicon history</h2>
    When navigating to pages, the small tab icon will be downloaded with it (favicon).
    Similar to other browsers, Vieb will only download these icons when they become outdated.
    You can configure the interval at which these favicons will be updated,
    by default they are updated once per session.
    There is also an option to disable the use of favicons completely.
    The favicons are used to show an icon in the tab bar,
    but also on the new tab page and on the history page.
    The favicons setting does not influence when these icons are removed again,
    but only when they should be updated again.
    The favicons will only be deleted when there are no pages in your history using that specific icon.
    For example, if you visited a website and you want to delete it's favicon,
    simply remove all the site visits from your history.
    Keep in mind that this process is not needed to refresh the favicons,
    as that is exactly what the favicons setting is used for.
    The favicons are stored in the folder of the same name in the Vieb data folder.
    <h2 id="history-other">download and tab history</h2>
    The download settings are explained in the <a href="#special-downloads">special page</a> section.
    To learn more about the tab history settings, see the <a href="#startup">startup chapter</a>.
    Because these settings are split between downloads, favicons, tabs and browsing history,
    you can fine-tune what you want to store and when to clear it automatically.
    <h2 id="history-private">private mode</h2>
    Having separate history settings means that there is no traditional private window available in Vieb,
    but by configuring the right settings, something equivalent can be achieved.
    An example for this based on the default settings can be something like this:
    <ul>
        <li>Set "downloads.removeCompleted" to true</li>
        <li>Set "history.storeNewVisits" to false</li>
        <li>Set "tabs.keepRecentlyClosed" to false</li>
    </ul>
    The combination of these settings means that once a tab is closed, or a download is completed,
    Vieb has no history stored in any of the three categories.
    You can of course expand these three settings with more strict settings,
    such as the option to clear any download regardless of progress when quitting,
    or the setting to never store the tabs at all by disabling the "tabs.restore" setting.
    It's also possible to open each tab in it's own container by setting "newtab.container" to true.
    Container tabs have a yellow title in the navigation bar and don't share data with any other tab.
    To make it easy to toggle between "private" mode and your regular settings,
    a custom keybinding could be added to the viebrc like this:
    <pre class="wrap">
{
    "keybindings": {
        "normal": {
            "KeyP": ":set downloads.removeCompleted! downloads.clearOnQuit! history.storeNewVisits! tabs.keepRecentlyClosed! tabs.restore! newtab.container!",
            "BracketLeft": ":set downloads.removeCompleted=false downloads.clearOnQuit=false history.storeNewVisits=true tabs.keepRecentlyClosed=true tabs.restore=true newtab.container=false",
            "BracketRight": ":set downloads.removeCompleted=true downloads.clearOnQuit=true history.storeNewVisits=false tabs.keepRecentlyClosed=false tabs.restore=false newtab.container=true"
        }
    }
}
</pre>
    From normal mode, <kbd>p</kbd> will now toggle between private and regular mode for all components.
    Also, <kbd>{</kbd> and <kbd>}</kbd> can be used to switch between them with separate keys.
    More information on how to change the settings can be found in the <a href="#settings">settings chapter</a>.
    <h1 id="adblocker">Adblocker</h1>
    Vieb includes an adblocker made by cliqz (see <a href="#mentions">mentions</a> for details).
    By default, the easylist and easyprivacy filter lists are included and enabled with Vieb.
    The lists will only be updated when a new Vieb released,
    unless you change the adblocker setting.
    The adblocker setting can be changed both with the viebrc and with the set command.
    There are four different options for the adblocker setting:
    <ul>
        <li>off - The adblocker won't be loaded, and no ads will be blocked</li>
        <li>
            static (default) - The adblocker will be loaded and block ads using built-in lists,
            but won't automatically update the easylist and easyprivacy filters.
            The lists will only be updated when downloading a new version of Vieb from the releases page.
            Additional lists can still be added as explained below.
        </li>
        <li>
            update - The adblocker will be loaded and block ads using built-in lists,
            but also automatically download the latest easylist and easyprivacy filter lists on startup.
            This is not the default, because connections to a third-party site should be opt-in.
            Additional lists can still be added as explained below.
        </li>
        <li>
            custom - The adblocker will only load when lists are added manually.
            This option should be used in case you don't want Vieb to manage the easylist and easyprivacy lists,
            but still want to block ads and/or trackers based on other filter lists.
            This option will not remove lists added by the other modes.
            You should check the "blocklists" folder for lists you might not want to use.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Regardless of the chosen option, you can add new lists to the "blocklists" subfolder inside the Vieb config folder,
    but only "custom" allows you to remove the easylist and easyprivacy filter lists.
    In case you want to add a different filter list, make sure it has the right extension and syntax,
    or go to <a href="https://easylist.to">easylist.to</a> for more information about these lists.
    It's also possible to update the easylist and easyprivacy filter lists just once,
    by switching to update mode and then switch to custom mode.
    <h1 id="special">Special pages</h1>
    Vieb has a couple of special pages that can be accessed like so "vieb://help".
    Most of these pages also have a dedicated command to navigate to them,
    but using nav mode to go there is possible as well.
    Each special page will be explained below.
    <h2 id="special-help">help page</h2>
    This is the current page and also a complete reference of Vieb's functionality.
    The location of this special page is "vieb://help".
    You can link to specific section of this page using "vieb://help#basics",
    or by calling the <a href="#commands-help">help command</a> with extra arguments.
    Simply pressing F1 will also open this help page at any time.
    <h2 id="special-downloads">downloads page</h2>
    This page displays a list of all the downloaded files using Vieb.
    The list is stored between sessions by default,
    but there are two related settings to change this behaviour:
    <ul>
        <li>
            downloads.removeCompleted -
            This setting can be set to true in case you want to remove all completed downloads from the list.
            You will still get a notification when a download is done,
            but it won't stay in the download history.
            Progressing or cancelled downloads will still be listed, even between sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
            downloads.clearOnQuit -
            This setting can be set to true if you want to clear the list on quit.
            When set to true, no download history will be saved to disk.
            The tab and browsing history are configured separately.
        </li>
    </ul>
    The download page can be accessed at "vieb://downloads" or with the <a href="#commands-downloads">downloads command</a>.
    <h2 id="special-version">version page</h2>
    This page contains the current Vieb version and a button to check for updates.
    It can be accessed with the :version command (:v), or as "vieb://version".
    <h2 id="special-history">history page</h2>
    On this page you can find all your browsing history.
    The page is sorted by date and contains breakpoints such as "Today" or "This hour",
    which you can jump to directly using the links at the top.
    There is also the option to delete specific pages from your history,
    or you can delete an entire day, week or everything.
    The history page can be opened using the <a href="#commands-history">history command</a>, or as "vieb://history".
    To change the history settings, see the <a href="#history">history chapter</a>.
    <h2 id="special-cookies">cookies page</h2>
    On the cookies page all cookies of the main session are listed.
    Container tabs use their own set of cookies, stored separately from these ones.
    To open a new tab in a separate container, use the following command:
    <pre class="command-block">set newtab.container=true</pre>
    Cookies of container tabs will be cleared when quitting Vieb or when closing the tab.
    The cookies of the main session can be edited on the cookie page,
    which can be found at "vieb://cookies" or can be opened with:
    <pre class="command-block">cookies</pre>
    On the cookies page there is an input field to filter the listed cookies.
    When filtering, only the listed cookies will be deleted by the remove all button,
    otherwise all cookies will be deleted when clicking it.
    Cookies can also be deleted individually using the small trash bins.
    Finally you can also configure Vieb to delete all cookies on quit:
    <pre class="command-block">set clearCookiesOnQuit=true</pre>
