## Erwic

With the "erwic" startup option, you can "Easily Run Websites In Containers".
The purpose of this option is similar to programs such as Franz, Ferdi or Rambox.
It can also replace other Electron-based desktop apps such as Slack or Discord.
These instances of Vieb can run separately from your existing Vieb.
See [Erwic.md](Erwic.md) for usage and details.

# Download

There are many ways to download and install Vieb.
Besides running from source or making your own builds,
these are the main sources to download Vieb.
For startup help, see the [frequently asked questions](FAQ.md).

### [Vieb.dev](https://vieb.dev/download)

The official Vieb website, where you can download the latest stable release for many platforms.

### [Github](https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb/releases)

The same releases that are offered on [vieb.dev](https://vieb.dev/download),
but with release notes and previous versions listed.

#### Third-party

These releases are made by users just like you for their favorite system.
Third-party releases might be outdated (in red) or customized compared to official builds,
but they are probably the simplest way to get started if your system is listed.

# Contribute

You can help by reporting issues and suggesting new features on the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb/issues).
Another way to help is by supporting Jelmerro on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/Jelmerro) or [github](https://github.com/sponsors/Jelmerro).
Donating is completely optional because Vieb will always be free and open source.
If you know how to write Electron applications, you can also help by writing code.
Check the ['help wanted' issues](https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"help+wanted") for suggestions on what to work on.
Please try to follow these guidelines while working on Vieb:

- Use Vim to edit :)
- Follow the included eslint style guide
- Use editorconfig for indentation

For an example vimrc that is configured to use these tools, you can check out my personal [vimrc](https://github.com/Jelmerro/vimrc).

# Building

To create your own builds or run Vieb from source, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
The next step is to clone the repository or download the source code.
After downloading, make sure you are in the cloned/extracted Vieb folder and run:

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

If this runs Vieb as expected, you can generate builds for your platform with `npm run build`.
To see the full list of run and build options, simply execute `npm run`.
The entire configuration for what to build is stored in the `electron-builder.yml` config file.
