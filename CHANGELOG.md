## [5.2.0](https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb/compare/5.1.0...5.2.0) - 2021-06-20

[code diff](https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb/compare/5.1.0...5.2.0) - [released builds](https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb/releases/tag/5.2.0)

## Added

- Action "repeatLastAction" to repeat the last called action or mapstring
- Action "p.restoreSelection" to restore the previously selected text in visual mode
- Mapping to execute the last executed command again (requires commandhist to be on "useronly" or "all")
- Cheatsheet for default mappings and general usage of Vieb to the help page, website and readme
- Example config for Vivaldi, Surfingkeys, Pentadactyl, Saka Key and Vim Vixen

## Changed

- More consistent opening of splits when many tabs are open

### Changed

- The history page will add all history DOM elements in bulk (much faster)
- Downloads are now handled in the main thread to improve consistency
- All checks with if statements now use includes wherever possible

### Fixed

- Losing focus when switching between certain modes
- Same for possibly losing focus when a website enters fullscreen
- Periodically toggle mouse focus to fully load websites that wait for the mouse to move
