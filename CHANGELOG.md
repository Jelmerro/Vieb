## Unreleased

### Added

- Local file suggestions to explore mode and to relevant commands
- New 'suggestfiles' setting to control when/if file suggestions should appear ('all' by default)
- Setting to control if file suggestions should appear before/after history in explore mode: suggestfilesfirst
- Red border in command mode when the entered command is invalid (for example due to unmatched quotes)
- Setting "closablepinnedtabs" which is disabled by default (meaning pinned tabs can't be closed)
- Setting "containernewtab" to control which container all new tabs should use (default is still "main")
- Setting "containersplitpage" to control which container all split pages should use (default is "s:usecurrent")
- Setting "containerstartuppage" to control which container the startup pages should use (CLI arguments, default is still "main")
- Setting "containercolors" to show container tabs in a custom color based on the container name
- Setting "containershowname" to optionally show the name of the container between the mode and url in the navbar
- Setting "containerkeeponreopen" to toggle the remembering the container name and to use the "containernewtab" setting instead
- Special container names to open tabs externally, in tabs with a matching domain, or use the same container as the current tab
- Support for SVG favicons by giving it an explicit ".svg" extension if detected by "is-svg"
- Devtools that can be opened as a split window or in a separate tab, in addition to the existing windowed developer tools

### Changed

- Suggestions are now scrollable when they don't fit the window
- The setting 'suggesthistory' has been renamed 'suggestexplore' as it might also include file suggestions now
- Command suggestions are now by default set to 1000, as the operation is simple and suggestions are scrollable
- Increased the upper limit for the number of suggestions (for both command and explore mode)
- Pinned tabs can no longer be closed, unless the 'closablepinnedtabs' setting is enabled
- Search setting parsing, you can now include %s as a substitute for the entered search
- Default duckduckgo search engine options now include a persistent header and infinite scrolling
- Tabs are now always modifiable in Erwic mode, because containers can now be managed at runtime
- Multiple tabs of the same special page can now be opened using the commands, as some of them are container specific
- The startup argument "--portable" has been replaced with "--datafolder", use "--datafolder ./ViebData" for old functionality
- Erwic now uses the "datafolder" startup argument instead of a JSON field for the datafolder location configuration

### Fixed

- Typo in the "storenewvisits" setting (there will be no automatic migration from the name with a typo to the correct one)
